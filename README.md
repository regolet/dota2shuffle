## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create `.env.local` in the `dota2shuffle-nextjs` directory:

```env
# Not required - admin credentials are now in database
# Run: npm run db:seed to create/reset admin user
```

### Customization

Edit constants in the codebase:

**Team Size** (`lib/shuffle.ts`):
```typescript
const TEAM_SIZE = 5  // Change for different team sizes
```

**Roles** (`lib/validators.ts`):
```typescript
export const DOTA_ROLES = ['Carry', 'Mid', 'Offlane', 'Pos4', 'Pos5']
```

## 🔒 Security

### Admin Password Management
1. Default password is `admin123`
2. Stored securely with bcrypt hashing
3. To change password: Use `npm run db:seed` to reset, or create a password change feature

### Session Management
- 24-hour session expiration
- HTTP-only cookies
- Secure cookies in production

### Database Security
- SQL injection protection via parameterized queries (Drizzle ORM)
- Input validation with Zod schemas
- No raw SQL queries

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Can't access admin dashboard
- Verify you're using correct credentials (admin/admin123)
- Try clearing browser cookies
- Check if database is initialized: `npm run db:push`

### Players can't register
- Check if registration link is active
- Verify max players limit hasn't been reached
- Check if player is banned in masterlist

### Teams won't shuffle
- Ensure at least 10 players are marked "Present"
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify players have valid MMR and roles

### Network access not working
- Verify firewall allows port 3000
- Ensure devices are on same network
- Try disabling VPN

### Database errors
- Delete `dota2shuffle.db` and run `npm run db:push` again
- Check file permissions on database file
- Verify SQLite is properly installed

## 🚀 Production Deployment

### Option 1: Local Server (Recommended for LAN events)

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

Access at `http://YOUR_IP:3000`

### Option 2: Deploy to Cloud

**Vercel** (No database persistence):
```bash
# Note: SQLite won't persist between deploys on Vercel
# Consider using Vercel Postgres or another cloud database
vercel deploy
```

**Self-hosted** (Docker):
```dockerfile
FROM node:20-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```
